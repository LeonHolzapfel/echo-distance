# Ultrasonic Distance Measurement
A small device that can roughly measure distance with an HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor.

# Parts needed
Here is a list of the parts needed which in combination with the [Ultrasonic Distance Measurement](resources/Ultrasonic_Distance_Measurement.pdf) can be used to rebuild the Daylight Sensor.

|Name  |Quantity|Component                                 |
|------|--------|------------------------------------------|
|U1    |1       | Arduino Uno R3                           |
|U2    |1       |MCP23008-based, 32 (0x20) LCD 16 x 2 (I2C)|
|DIST1 |1       | HC-SR04                                  |
