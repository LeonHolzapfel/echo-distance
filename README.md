# Echo Distance Measurement
A small device that can roughly measure distance with an HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor.

# Parts needed
Here is a list of the parts needed which in combination with the [Echo Distance Measurement](resources/Echo_Distance_Measurement.pdf) can be used to rebuild the Echo Distance Measurement Device.
